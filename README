### GetJSON Example
```VB.net
Function GetDirections(Origin As String, Destination As String) As String
    ' Create a WebClient for executing requests
    ' and set a base url that all requests will be appended to
    Dim MapsClient As New WebClient
    MapsClient.BaseUrl = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/"
    
    ' Use GetJSON helper to execute simple request and work with response
    Dim Resource As String
    Dim Response As WebResponse
    
    Resource = "directions/json?" & _
        "origin=" & Origin & _
        "&destination=" & Destination & _
        "&sensor=false"
    Set Response = MapsClient.GetJSON(Resource)
    
    ' => GET https://maps.../api/directions/json?origin=...&destination=...&sensor=false
